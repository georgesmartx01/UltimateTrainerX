This code should be ran and viewed on Apache or similar private servers than can run PHP and SQL files together.

Instructions for using this code:
1. Prequisites
a. Install XAMPP and Visual Studio Code installed before proceeding to the next steps.

Links:
i) https://www.apachefriends.org/
ii) https://code.visualstudio.com/

b. Once you have XAMPP and Visual Studio Code installed, open both.
c. Download the source code from the GitHub repository and extract the files once downloaded.
d. Copy over the files to "C:\xampp\htdocs" directory.
e. Looking at XAMPP, look for "Apache" and "MySQL" and click on the "Start" button for both to make the connection to the code contained in the UltimateTrainerX.
f. You will get an error message at first that there is no database. Note: you need to go to "localhost/phpmyadmin" (without quotes) to create the database.
g. Click on "New" and once the page for creating the database immediately appears, type the database name as follows: "ultimatetrainerx".
h. Now that the database is created, go to "SQL", copy the CREATE TABLE and CREATE INDEX statements into the SQL area.
i. After doing that, you have the database. Then, finally, copy all of the INSERT INTO statements into the SQL and you should have all of the data in the database.
Note: This is useful if you need full access to everything contained in my project, so you don't face issues.
